# Unveiling Global Economic Resilience: A Dynamic Visualization of Interconnectedness

**Overview:**

This project aims to visualize the interconnectedness of global economic indicators and identify regions and sectors demonstrating resilience to economic shocks.  The analysis leverages key economic data to create an interactive dashboard, providing insights valuable for strategic investment planning.  The visualization allows users to explore correlations between various indicators and understand the relative stability of different economic segments across the globe.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* [Add other libraries as needed, e.g., Plotly, Dash]


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries using:  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using: `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will produce the following outputs:

* **Console Output:**  Printed analysis summarizing key findings regarding economic resilience across different regions and sectors. This includes statistical measures quantifying correlations and resilience levels.
* **Interactive Dashboard (if applicable):** An interactive visualization (e.g., using Plotly or Dash) allowing exploration of the data and its correlations. This will either be launched in a web browser or saved as an HTML file.
* **Static Plots (if applicable):**  Generated plot files (e.g., `correlation_matrix.png`, `resilience_map.png`) visualizing key relationships and patterns identified in the data.  These will be saved in the `output` directory.
